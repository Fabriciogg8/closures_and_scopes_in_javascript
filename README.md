# Closures and scopes in Javascript

## VAR - LET - CONST

* **Var**: Accepts being re assigned an also be re declared. This may cause errors, if we don't pay attention. The advice is not to use it.
* **Let**: Can be re assign, but it can't be re declared showing an error.
* **Const**: This is a constant, so it can't be re assigned, and also dont'accept being re declared. 

## Code Blocks

A structure like an ***if*** is a code block. With **let** and **const** we can only access them inside the block. In the other hand with var we can access outside the block (file block.js)
